  "introduction": "Welcome to Virtual Structural Analysis-II Lab. This laboratory provides platform to inquisitive students to perform basic experiments related to structural analysis-II, either remotely or through simulation. Structural analysis is a fundamental aspect of civil engineering and architecture which involves the study of various techniques used to evaluate the structures to ensure they can withstand various loads and forces without failure. Load Analysis: This involves determining the various loads acting on a structure, such as dead loads (the weight of the structure itself), live loads (the weight of occupants or materials), wind loads, seismic loads, temperature effects, etc",
